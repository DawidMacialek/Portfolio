Hello there!
This is my first official portfolio website. 
The website includes my projects which I have done during my learning path. You can find there links to the github pages that you can check my skills out. You are very welcome to do any code review and I will be extremely happy if you leave any advice or tips. You can reach me at macialekdawid@gmail.com.  Enjoy!
